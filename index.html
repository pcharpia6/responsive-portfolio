                    I work for a data generation company in RTP specializing 
                    in Metabolomics. Specifically I manage the chemistry 
                    personnel providing samples to be analyzed. This position 
                    supplies a never-ending list of new and <em>exciting</em> 
                    challenges every day. I have become quite knowledgable about 
                    extraction chemistry, personality management, long-term task 
                    completion tracking, and also quite skilled in problem solving.

                    I met my wife on the dating website <em>E-Harmony</em> 5 years 
                    ago. It did not take long for us to be married and ready to find 
                    a place to settle down. Mebane has wonderful amenities and a small 
                    town feel, not to mention the cheapest property taxes in the area, 
                    and so we found a small house to buy. We make such a great team 
                    that we decided to grow our team, and we took on a beautiful 
                    healthy baby boy in December of 2016. His joy and energy make a 
                    wonderful end to every day.

                    Now I have decided to take on the mammoth task of learning 
                    web development computer engineering. Hopefully the UNC 
                    Coding Bootcamp will help that process along!
